I am **Yanran Li**, a Research Assistant now at PolyU. 

On this blog, I mostly write about Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, Social Network Analysis, Applied Machine Learning and Optimization and issues with *R* language. 

I am a Bachelor in the Centre of Information Science, School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science(EECS), Peking University. I work with [Prof. Sujian Li](http://www.icl.pku.edu.cn/member/lisujian/) and [Prof. Wenjie Li](http://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~cswjli/). I also do some research at Microsoft as **Applied Researcher and Developer**.
